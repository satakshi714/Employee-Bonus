You are given the following two tables:
Table: employee
emp_id(int)	emp_name(varchar)	department(varchar)	salary(int

Table: bonus
emp_id(int)	bonus(int)

The bonus table has a foreign key referencing employee(emp_id).
Some employees may not have a bonus, resulting in NULL values.
Write an SQL query to display the following for all employees:
•	Employee name (emp_name)
•	Department (department)
•	Total compensation (calculated as salary + bonus)

Note:
If the bonus is NULL, it should be treated as 0 during the calculation of total compensation.
The output should display columns as:
emp_name, department, total_compensation.
